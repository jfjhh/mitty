TODO
====

- Arc length stuff.
- Period and/or domain finding?
- Matrix transformations on curves (antik and grid stuff).
- Piecewise curves.
- Better GUI / CL macros for easy-to-use interface (mouse dragging/sculpting?).
- Exporting curve data to other formats and interpolations. E.g.:
  - SVG, Postscript, bitmaps, (gnuplot?).
  - Linear, arc, and Bezier curve interpolation in output.
