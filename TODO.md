TODO
====

- Danmaku-style particle motion parametric stuff and interpolating those points.
- Physics or pseudo-physics on curve points: like springs between points or
	manipulation by specifying fields that exert forces.
- Various kinds of curve-curve interaction: collision, joining, tangency
	constraints, etc.
- Arc length stuff.
- Period and/or domain finding?
- Matrix transformations on curves (antik and grid stuff).
- Piecewise curves.
- Better GUI / CL macros for easy-to-use interface (mouse dragging/sculpting?).
- Exporting curve data to other formats and interpolations. E.g.:
	+ SVG, Postscript, bitmaps, (gnuplot?).
	+ Linear, arc, and Bezier curve interpolation in output.
